# --- Day 1: Inverse Captcha ---
# 
# The night before Christmas, one of Santa's Elves calls you in a panic.
# "The printer's broken! We can't print the Naughty or Nice List!" By the time
# you make it to sub-basement 17, there are only a few minutes until midnight.
# "We have a big problem," she says; "there must be almost fifty bugs in this
# system, but nothing else can print The List. Stand in this square, quick!
# There's no time to explain; if you can convince them to pay you in stars,
# you'll be able to--" She pulls a lever and the world goes blurry.
# 
# When your eyes can focus again, everything seems a lot more pixelated than
# before. She must have sent you inside the computer! You check the system
# clock: 25 milliseconds until midnight. With that much time, you should be able
# to collect all fifty stars by December 25th.
# 
# Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each
# day millisecond in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you
# complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
# 
# You're standing in a room with "digitization quarantine" written in LEDs along
# one wall. The only door is locked, but it includes a small interface.
# "Restricted Area - Strictly No Digitized Users Allowed."
# 
# It goes on to explain that you may only leave by solving a captcha to prove
# you're not a human. Apparently, you only get one millisecond to solve the
# captcha: too fast for a normal human, but it feels like hours to you.
# 
# The captcha requires you to review a sequence of digits (your puzzle input)
# and find the sum of all digits that match the next digit in the list. The list
# is circular, so the digit after the last digit is the first digit in the list.
# 
# For example:
# 
#  - 1122 produces a sum of 3 (1 + 2) because the first digit (1) matches the
#    second digit and the third digit (2) matches the fourth digit.
#  - 1111 produces 4 because each digit (all 1) matches the next.
#  - 1234 produces 0 because no digit matches the next.
#  - 91212129 produces 9 because the only digit that matches the next one is the
#    last digit, 9.
#
# What is the solution to your captcha?
# 
# Your puzzle answer was 1044.
# 
# The first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *
#
#
# --- Part Two ---
# 
# You notice a progress bar that jumps to 50% completion. Apparently, the door
# isn't yet satisfied, but it did emit a star as encouragement. The instructions
# change:
# 
# Now, instead of considering the next digit, it wants you to consider the digit
# halfway around the circular list. That is, if your list contains 10 items,
# only include a digit in your sum if the digit 10/2 = 5 steps forward matches
# it. Fortunately, your list has an even number of elements.
# 
# For example:
# 
#  - 1212 produces 6: the list contains 4 items, and all four digits match the
#    digit 2 items ahead.
#  - 1221 produces 0, because every comparison is between a 1 and a 2.
#  - 123425 produces 4, because both 2s match each other, but no other digit has
#    a match.
#  - 123123 produces 12.
#  - 12131415 produces 4.
#
# What is the solution to your new captcha?
#
# Your puzzle answer was 1054.
#
# Both parts of this puzzle are complete! They provide two gold stars: **
